# MTUSep24DSC
# Making an attempt with Lab 2 - Java Collections framework
#   Got the absolute path for the hamlet.txt file and updated it in file handling.

# ArrayListDriver - I played around with the arraylist using different names. 
# I tried counting how many names were added into the list as well as finding if my name was present

# LinkedListDemo - I played around with creating my own linked list based off companies offering internships and was able to remove them as if they became unavailable.
# Iterator vs Enhanced For Loop
# "For-each is syntactic sugar for using iterators" - Stack Over Flow
# Syntactic sugar supposedly is easier to read and write thus making your code that much "Sweeter"
# Iterators are a good choice if you wish to modify what is currently in the List as trying to do so within a for loop would cause an error(attempted with my code)
